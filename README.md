# skillup

## Project Description

The SkillUP! app is an app that helps users to improve their skills through practice. The user will be able to select a skill and choose a challenge to practice. 
At its core, this app is essentially a collection of project ideas (prompts) to give users a springboard to develop their abilities in a select skill and potentially build portfolio pieces. In much later development, I can see this concept being a powerful community development tool as well, where users can share progress, provide feedback, and even add extra challenges to build on concepts.
This version will only include two skills to start with.

Models:

Skill Model:
